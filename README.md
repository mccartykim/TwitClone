Yet Another Twitclone Project

As a learning exercise, I will program a simple web app that has the most basic functionality of Twitter.

Users can upload 140 or less characters in a post, and follow users to get a stream of other users' posts.

This project will require me to use templates, a scripting language, and SQL or another type of database.  I'd also like to practice making a non-terrible log-in system, although I fear I'd be in over my head.

I'm hoping to first do this with not too many outside libraries.  While libraries simplify the job and offer secure and efficient implementations, I find myself in a gap needing to develop my skills.
